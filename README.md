```lrc
[00:20.28] Question for you right there
[00:21.89] Do you honestly just not care?
[00:25.00] I get the feeling that is not the case
[00:28.33] Poker face
[00:29.96] Everyone has the right to go and see the other side, so
[00:34.96] Break down the barricade
[00:37.49] Before it ends in pain
[00:41.62] I know you were not made to follow
[00:58.62] 
[00:50.18] The revolution in your heart
[00:53.38] Will guide your way
[00:55.76] Will guide your way through the dark
[00:59.83] Remember, only you can redefine your world
[01:03.53] To bring the dream alive
[01:06.04] Light the flame in your eyes
[01:20.04] 
[01:09.57] If you remain a soul unheard
[01:13.05] What would they give?
[01:15.59] What would they give in return?
[01:19.48] If you are left to rot and crumble down into the dust, then
[01:24.23] Wave that flag
[01:26.16] We can drive them mad
